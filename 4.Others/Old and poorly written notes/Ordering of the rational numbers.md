We say a rational number $x$ is positive if $x=a/b$ for some positive integers. We say a rational number is negative is it is the negation of a positive rational number.

From this follows the trichotomy of the rationals. Let $x$ be a rational number. Then exactly one of the following is true: $x$ is zero, $x$ is a positive rational number, $x$ is a negative rational number.




#### *Proof of trichotomy*

Considering $x=a/b$ we have according to the trichotomy of the integers that:

|$a/b$ |$a>0$ | $a< 0$ | $a=0$|  
|-|-|-|-|
|$b>0$|$+$|$-$|$0$
|$b<0$|$-$|$+$|$0$

Thus we know at least one is true for every $a$ and $b$. One can super easily show the obvious paradoxes that appear if one says $x$ can be positive and negative or positive and zero etc... . And thus there is exactly one statement that is true.
