Let $A$, $B$ be sets. We say that $A$ is a subset of $B$, denoted $A ⊆ B$, if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, i.e. For any object $x$, $x ∈ A \implies x ∈ B$. We say that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, denoted $A\subset B$, if $A ⊆ B$ and $A \neq B$.We can see that that the notion of subset obeys the axiom of substitution, which in this case translates to: $A⊆ B    \land A = A' \implies A' ⊆ B$
This doesn't need to be proven as in fact the notion of subsets is defined in terms of the element operation, which we already prove that it obeys the axiom.

We also note that the empty set is always a subset of a set (including itself) since all it's element are in any set, because it doesn't have any.
