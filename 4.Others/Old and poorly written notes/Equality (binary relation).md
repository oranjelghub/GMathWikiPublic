The equality, indicated by the sign "$=$", is a [[Relations|binary relation]] that takes 2 object of any class $T$ and links them together in order to create true or wrong statements. Equality is a type of [[Equivalence relations|equivalence relation]] and thus must abide the following axioms:

1. Reflexive axiom, given any object $x$ we have: $$x=x$$
2. Symmetric axiom, gives any 2 objects $x$ and $y$  of the same class: $$x=y \Longleftrightarrow y=x$$
3. Transitive axiom, given any 3 objects $x$ , $y$ and $z$ of the same class: $$x=y \land y=z \implies x=z$$
4. Substitution axiom , given any 2 object $x$ and $y$ from the same class and a [[Functions|function]] or operation $f$ that pertains to the class of the objects: $$a=b \implies f(a)=f(b)$$
