If $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is a function then we define the graph of $f$ to be the subset of $X \times Y$ defined by $\{(x, f(x)) : x ∈ X\}$.

From this basic function follows that:
$$f=g \iff \{(x, f(x)) : x ∈ X\}=\{(x, g(x)) : x ∈ X\}$$
This can be easily proven knowing the definition of equality of sets, functions and $n$-tuples.
Conversely we have that if $G$ is any subset of $X \times Y$ with the property that for each $x ∈ X$, the set $\{y ∈ Y : (x, y) ∈ G\}$ has exactly one element (or in other words, $G$ obeys the vertical line test), then there is exactly one function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ whose graph is equal to $G$.
