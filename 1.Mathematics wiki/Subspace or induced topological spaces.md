We try to capture a notion of sub topology as follows

> [!quote] Notion: Induced topology or subspace topology
> Given a topological space $(T,\tau)$ and $S\subset T$ we define the induced topology $\Theta_{T}$ with the definition: $$\theta \in \Theta_{T} \iff \theta=S \cap \tau_{i}$$ Where $\tau_{i}$ is some element of $\tau$.

We denote this topological space $(S, \Theta_{T})$.
