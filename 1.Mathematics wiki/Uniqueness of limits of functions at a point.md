> [!quote] Theorem: Uniqueness of limits of functions at a point
> Given some set $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, some function $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$, some set $E\subseteq X$ and some point $x_{0}$ adherent to $E$. Given that $\lim_{ x \to x_0:x\in E }f(x)=L$, the limit of $f$ at $x_0$ is unique.

We won't provide a full proof as it is quiet trivial, the result follows from the equivalence of the classic definition with the sequential one. And that if the function were to have two different limits, then it would contradict the uniqueness of the limit of a sequence.
