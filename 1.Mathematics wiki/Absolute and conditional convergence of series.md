> [!quote] Definition: Absolute and conditional convergence of series
> A formal infinite series $\sum^{\infty}_{n=m}a_{n}$ is said to be absolutely convergent if and only if $\sum^{\infty}_{n=m}|a_{n}|$ is convergent. Otherwise if the series is convergent in it's normal state then we say it is conditionally convergent.

We can show that absolute convergence implies conditional convergence, making it a valid test for the convergence of a series. (See: [[Absolute convergence test for series]])
