The following properties hold regarding the dimension of a vector space:

>[!quote] Theorem: Dimension of a vector space
>1. If $\dim V =n$ then $\{ v_{i} \}_{1\leq i\leq n}$ is a basis if and only if it a set of free vectors or if and only if it a set of vectors spanning $V$.
>2. If $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space and $U\subset_{\text{vec}}V$ then $U$ is finite dimensional and $\dim U\leq \dim V$
>3. If $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space and $U\subset_{\text{vec}}V$ then $$ \dim U =\dim V \iff U=V $$
