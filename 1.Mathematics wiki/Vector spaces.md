> [!quote] Definition: Vector space
> A vector space $(V,+,*)$ over a Field $F$ is a Abelian group $(V,+)$ on endowed with some external operation $$*:F \times V \to V: (\lambda,v ) \mapsto \lambda *v$$Such that the following properties are satisfied:
>- Distributivity of scaling with regards to addition:$$\lambda*(v_1+v_2)=\lambda*v_1+\lambda*v_2$$
>- Distributivity of scaling with regards to field addition:$$(\lambda_1+_F\lambda_2)v=\lambda_1*v+\lambda_2*v$$
>- Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication: $$\lambda_{1}(\lambda_{2}*v)=(\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2})*v$$
