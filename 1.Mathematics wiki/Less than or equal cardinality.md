Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Let us say that $A$ has lesser or equal cardinality to $B$ if there exists an injection $f : A \rightarrow B$ from $A$ to $B$. Show that if A and B are finite sets, then A has lesser or equal cardinality to B if and only if $$\exists f_{A\rightarrow B}\land f\;\text{is injective}\iff\#(A) ≤ \#(B)$$
