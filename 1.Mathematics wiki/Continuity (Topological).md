Types: [[Continuity (Metric space)]], [[Continuity of real valued functions]]
Examples: _Not applicable_
Construction: [[Continuous functions involving the discrete and indiscrete topology]]
Generalization: [[Continuity]]

Properties: [[Topological continuity is preserved under composition]]
Sufficiencies: _Not applicable_
Equivalences: _Not applicable_
Justifications: [[Topological continuity is consistent with metric space continuity]], [[Topological spaces]]

We abstract the notion of [[Continuity]] beyond just [[Metric spaces]] into [[Topological spaces]].

> [!quote] Notion: Continuity in topological spaces
> Given a function $f:T_{Y} \to T_{Y}$ where $(T_{X},\tau_{X})$ and $(T_{Y},\tau_{Y})$ are [[Topological spaces]], $f$ is said to be continuous if and only if: $$\forall \tau_{y}\in \tau_{Y}, f^{-1}(\tau_{y})\in \tau_{X} $$
