From the notion of [[Upper bounds]] we develop a definition for least upper bounds.

> [!quote] Definition: Least upper bound
> Given $E \subseteq \mathbb R$, we say $M$ is a least upper bound if and only if: 
> 1. $M$ is an [[Upper bounds|upper bound]] for $E$
> 2. For any other [[Upper bounds|upper bound]] $M'$ of $E$ we must have $M\leq M'$
