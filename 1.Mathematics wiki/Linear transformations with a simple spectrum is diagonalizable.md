> [!quote] Theorem:
> Let $V$ be a $n$-dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-vector space and $L:V\to V$ a linear transformation with a simple spectrum $\text{Spec}(L)$. Then $L$ is diagonalizable.

The proof follows directly from the fact that we can construct a set of eigenvectors each having exactly one eigenvalue in $\text{Spec}(L)$, meaning that set would be free and thus form a basis.
