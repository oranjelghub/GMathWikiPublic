> [!quote] Theorem: Dimension of a vector space is well-defined
> Let $V$ be some $F$-vector space and let $\beta_1$ and $\beta_{2}$ be two bases of $V$, then $$ \left| \beta_{1} \right| =\left| \beta_{2} \right|  $$

>[!quote] Proof: Dimension of a vector space is well-defined
>Since $\beta_{1}$ is a set of free vectors and $\beta_{2}$ spans $V$ we know that $$ \left| \beta_{1} \right| \leq \left| \beta_{2} \right|  $$We can similarly argue that $$ \left| \beta_{2} \right| \leq \left| \beta_{1} \right|  $$Thus $$ \left| \beta_{1} \right| =\left| \beta_{2} \right|  $$
