> [!quote] Notion: Bounded real valued functions
> Let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and let $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ be some functions, we say $f$ is bounded if and only if $$ \exists M\in \mathbb{R}: \forall x\in X, \left| f(x) \right| \leq M $$

In other words there exists some real $M$ such that $f(X)\subseteq [-M,M]$
