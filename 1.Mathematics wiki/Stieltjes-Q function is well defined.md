> [!quote] Theorem: Stieltjes-$\mathbb{Q}$ function is well defined
> Let $\Xi_{\mathbb{Q}}$ be the Stieltjes-$\mathbb{Q}$ function with respect to some arbitrary bijective sequence $(q_n)^\infty_{n=0}$ which maps $\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Q}$. Then $\Xi_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is well defined for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$.

>[!quote] Proof: Stieltjes-$\mathbb{Q}$ function is well defined
>By the theory around geometric series we know that $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}2^{-n}$ is absolutely convergent and thus so is $\sum_{r\in \mathbb Q}g(r)$. Specifically, the Stieltjes-$\mathbb{Q}$ is a well define function since $\sum_{r\in \mathbb Q: r<x}g(r)$ is absolutely convergent.
