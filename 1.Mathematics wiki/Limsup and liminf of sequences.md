We define a notion of superior and inferior limits to describe limit like behavior that doesn't exactly converge.

> [!quote] Notion: Limit superior and inferior
> Given a sequence $(a_{n})^\infty_{n=m}$ we define the limit superior as: $$ \limsup_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}:= \inf(a_{N}^+)^\infty_{N=m}  $$ Where: $$a_{N}^+:=\sup(a_{n})^\infty_{n=N}$$ In the same fashion: $$ \liminf_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}:= \sup(a_{N}^-)^\infty_{N=m}  $$ Where: $$a_{N}^-:=\inf(a_{n})^\infty_{n=N}$$

We often denote them $L^+$ and $L^-$.
