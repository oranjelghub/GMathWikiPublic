Using the notion of [[Generator of a group]] we can construct the notion of presentation

> [!quote] Notion: Presentation of group 
> Given a group $G$, we define a presentation of $G$ to be a group generated by the following: $$\langle S:P_1,\ldots,P_n \rangle$$ Where $P$ denotes a property pertaining to elements of $S$.

Presentation are a nice way of defining groups, although not perfect because equality and order of the group is very unpredictable due to the possible strange combinations of properties $P$.
