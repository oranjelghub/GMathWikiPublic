>[!quote] Theorem: Order of the dihedral group
>The order of the Dihedral group $D_{2n}$ is equal to $2n$. $$|D_{2n}|=2n$$

We shall proof this statements

> [!quote] Proof:
> In order to formally proof the order of the dihedral group we have to show a bijection between $D_{2n}$ and $\{1\leq i\leq 2n\}$ to basically show they have the same cardinality. We thus define the following function: $$
> f:D_{2n}\rightarrow \{1\leq i\leq 2n\}:\pi\mapsto \left\{\begin{align} i &\hspace{1cm} \pi=\sigma_i\land\sigma(1)=i\\ n+i&\hspace{1cm} \pi=\tau_i \land \tau_i(i)=i \end{align}\right.$$
> Notice that one can show this function is bijective, meaning $D_{2n}$ has cardinality or order $2n$.
