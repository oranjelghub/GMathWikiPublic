In order to formally assert the existence of matrices we define them the following way:

> [!quote] Notion: Formal matrix
> $$A=\begin{bmatrix} f_{11}&\ldots &f_{1n} \\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots \\f_{m1}&\ldots& f_{mn}  \end{bmatrix}=((f_{ij})_{1\leq i\leq n})_{1\leq j\leq m}$$

We can also formally construct the set $M_{m\times n}(F)$ as follows:

> [!quote] Notion: Formal set of all $m\times n$ matrices over a [[Fields|field]] $F$
> $$M_{m\times n}(F)=\prod_{1\leq j\leq m}\prod_{1\leq i\leq n}F$$
