A metric on a set $X$ is defined as followed:

> [!quote] Definition: Metric
> A metric on a set $X$ is a function: $$d:X^2\rightarrow\mathbb [0,+\infty)$$ Which also satisfies the following four properties:
> - $d(x,y)=0\iff x=y$
> - $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$ (Symmetry)
> - $d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$ (Triangle inequality)
