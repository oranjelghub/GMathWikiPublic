> [!quote] Theorem: Differential calculus
> Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $x_{0}\in X$ be a limit point of $X$, and let $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ and $g:X\to \mathbb{R}$.
> 1. If $f(x)=c$ for some $c\in \mathbb{R}$ and for all $x\in X$, then $f$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $f'(x_{0})=0$.
> 2. If $f(x)=x$ for all $x\in X$, then $f$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $f'(x_{0})=1$.
> 3. If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $x_{0}$, then so is $f+g$ and $(f+g)'(x_{0})=f'(x_{0})+g'(x_{0})$.
> 4. If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $x_{0}$, then so is $fg$ and $(fg)'(x_{0})=f'(x_{0})g(x_{0})+f(x_{0})g'(x_{0})$.
> 5. If $f$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $c\in \mathbb{R}$, then $cf$ is also differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $(cf)'(x_{0})=cf'(x_{0})$.
> 6. If $g$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $g$ is non-zero on $X$, then $\frac{1}{g}$ is also differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $\left( \frac{1}{g} \right)'(x_{0})=-\frac{g'(x_{0})}{g(x_{0})^{2}}$
> 7. If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $g$ is non-zero on $X$, then $\frac{f}{g}$ is also differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $\left( \frac{f}{g}' \right)(x_{0})=\frac{f'(x_{0})g(x_{0})-f(x_{0})g'(x_{0})}{g(x_{0})^{2}}$
