A binary operation is an [[Operations|operation]] of arity $2$.

> [!quote] Definition: Operation
>$$f:X^{2}\rightarrow X: (a,b)\mapsto f((a,b))$$

This definition implies that $f$ is defined over it's whole domain and that $f(X^{2})\subseteq X$ (operation is closed).

Besides that, a binary operation can exhibit the following properties:

> [!quote]- Notion: Properties and classification of binary operations
> - Commutativity: $f(a,b)=f(b,a)$
> - Associativity: $f(a,f(b,c))=f(f(a,b),c)$
> - Identity element $e$ in $X$: $f(a,e)=a=f(e,a)$
> - Inverse element $a^{-1}$ in $X$ from an element $a$ in $X$: $f(a,a^{-1})=e=f(a^{-1},a)$
