Continuity is a important properties of real valued functions.

> [!quote] Notion: Continuity of real valued functions
> Given $f:X\to \mathbb R$ with $X \subseteq \mathbb R$, $f$ is said to be continuous in $x_0\in X$ if and only if: $$ \forall \varepsilon >0\; \exists \delta >0: \left| x-x_0 \right|<\delta \implies \left| f(x)-f(x_0) \right| < \varepsilon$$

Equivalently using the definition of a limits at a point we have 

>[!quote] Notion: Continuity of real valued functions through limits
>A function $f$ is said to be continuous at $x_0\in X$ if and only if $$\lim_{x\to x_0: x\in X}f(x)=f(x_0)$$
