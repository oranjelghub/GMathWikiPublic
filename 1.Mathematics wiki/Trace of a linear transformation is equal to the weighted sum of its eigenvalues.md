> [!quote] Theorem: Trace of a linear transformation is equal to the weighted sum of its eigenvalues
> Let $V$ be a $n$-dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-vector space and $L:V\to V$ a linear transformation. Then $$ \mathrm{Tr}(L)=\sum^{}_{\lambda\in \text{Spec}(L)}m(\lambda)\lambda $$Where $m(\lambda)$ is the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue.

Alternatively this also holds for $\mathbb{R}$-vector spaces, as long as $\varphi_{L}$ is fully factorisable. The proof is not very complicated when making use of Vieta's formulas and the Laplace expansion.
