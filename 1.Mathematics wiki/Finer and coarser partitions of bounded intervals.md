> [!quote] Definition: Finer and coarser partitions of bounded intervals
> Let $I$ be a bounded interval, and $P$ and $P'$ two partitions of $I$. We say that $P$ is finer than $P'$ (or $P'$ is coarser than $P$) and write $P\preceq P'$ if and only if for every $J\in P$ we have $J\subseteq K$ for some $K\in P'$.
