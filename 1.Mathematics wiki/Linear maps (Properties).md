> [!quote] Theorem: Linear maps (Properties)
> Let $L:V\to W$ be a linear map of two $F$-vector spaces. Then 
> 1. $L(0)=0$ and $L(-v)=-L(v)$
> 2. $$L\left( \sum^{n}_{i=1}\lambda_{i}v_{i} \right)=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\lambda_{i}L(v_{i}) $$
> 3. Given $\beta$ some basis of $V$. $L$ is uniquely determined by $L(\beta)$.
> 4. If $L':W\to U$ is also a linear map then $L'\circ L$ is also linear.

We do not prove these properties as they are quite trivial.
