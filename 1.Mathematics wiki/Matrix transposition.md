> [!quote] Definition: Transposed matrix
> Given $A\in M_{m\times n}(F)$ we define the transposed matrix $A^T$ as being the matrix such that:$$(A^T)_{ij}=(A)_{ji}$$

We then further classify matrices depending on their behaviour under transposition.

>[!quote]- Notion: Classification of matrices under transposition
>- $A$ is symmetric $\iff A^T=A$
>- $A$ is skew-symmetric $\iff A^T=-A$

Note that these are only possible for square matrices.
