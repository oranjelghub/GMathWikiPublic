>[!quote] Theorem: Properties of open subsets
>1. $\text{int}(\text{int}(Y))=\text{int}(Y)$
>2. $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ where all $U_i$ are open in a [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $X$ $\implies \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$ is open.
>3. $U$ is open in a [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $X$ $\iff U=\bigcup_{x\in U}B(x,r(x))$
>4. $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ with all $U_i$ open in a [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $X$ and $I$ is finite $\implies \bigcap_{i\in I}U_i$ is open.
>5. Given $Y$ a subspace of the [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $X$, a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $U=V\cap Y$ for some open subset $V$ in $X$
