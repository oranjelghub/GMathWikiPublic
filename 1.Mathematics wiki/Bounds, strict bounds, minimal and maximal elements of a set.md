> [!quote] Definition: Minimal and maximal element of a partially ordered set
> Let $X$ be a partially ordered set, and let $Y$ be a subset of $X$. We say that $y$ is a minimal element of $Y$ if $y\in  Y$ and there is no element $y′ \in Y$ such that $y′ < y$. We say that $y$ is a maximal element of $Y$ if $y \in Y$ and there is no element $y′ \in Y$ such that $y < y′$.

>[!quote] Definition: Upper bound and strict upper bound of a partially ordered set
> Let $X$ be a partially ordered set with ordering relation $\leq_{X}$, and let $Y$ be a subset of $X$. If $x \in  X$, we say that $x$ is an upper bound for $Y$ iff $y \leq_X x$ for all $y \in Y$. If in addition $x \not\in Y$ , we say that $x$ is a strict upper bound for $Y$.
