Just like a direct sum we want to develop a direct product of vector spaces.

> [!quote] Notion: Direct product of vector spaces
> Given $V$ and $W$ two vector spaces over the same field $K$, we can define their product: $$V \otimes W := V \times W$$ Where $V \otimes W$ is equipped with component wise addition and scalar multiplication.

It is easy to verify this forms a vector space.
