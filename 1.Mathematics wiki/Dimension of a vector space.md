> [!quote] Definition: Dimension of a vector space
> Given a $F$-vector space $V$ and a basis of that space $\{ v_{i} \}_{1\leq i \leq n}$, we define $$ \dim V=\left| \{ v_{i} \}_{1\leq i\leq n} \right| = n $$

In order for this to be a meaningful definition we must have that the dimension of $V$ is consistent regardless of the basis.
