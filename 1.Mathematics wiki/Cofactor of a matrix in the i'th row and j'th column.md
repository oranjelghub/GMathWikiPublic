> [!quote] Definition: Cofactor of a matrix in the i'th row and j'th column
> Let $A \in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ be a matrix, then we call $\mathfrak C_{ij}$ the cofactor in the $i$'th row and $j$'th column, defined by $$ \mathfrak C_{ij}:= (-1)^{i+j}m_{ij} $$Where $m_{ij}$ is the minor of $A$ in the $i$th row and $j$'th column.
