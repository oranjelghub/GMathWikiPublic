> [!quote] Notion: Divergent series
> A series is said to diverge of to $+\infty$, or properly diverge, if and only if $$ \limsup_{ N \to \infty }\sum^{N}_{n=0} a_{n}=\liminf_{ N \to \infty }\sum^{N}_{n=0}a_{n} = +\infty $$ The definition is symmetric for $-\infty$.

We sometimes then define the series to be equal to $+\infty$ in order to develop some algebraic properties regarding those divergent series. But this does generally force us to endow an actual algebra on $\mathbb{R}\cup \{ -\infty,+\infty \}$.
