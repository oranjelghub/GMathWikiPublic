Given a vector space $V$ we can develop a notion of dependence.

> [!quote] Definition: Linear dependence
> A set of vectors $\{ v_{i} \}_{1\leq i\leq n}$ are said to be linearly dependent if there exists a set of scalars which are not all $0$ such that: $$ \sum^{n}_{i=1} f_{i}v_{i}=0
$$

If those scalars don't exists then we say the vectors of $\{ v_{i} \}_{1\leq i\leq n}$ are linearly independent.
