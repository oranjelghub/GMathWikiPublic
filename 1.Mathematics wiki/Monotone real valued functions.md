> [!quote] Definition: Monotone real valued functions
> Let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, and let $f : X → \mathbb{R}$ be a function. We say that $f$ is monotone increasing iff $f (y) ≥ f (x)$ whenever $x, y ∈ X$ and $y > x$. We say that $f$ is strictly monotone increasing iff $f (y) > f (x)$ whenever $x, y ∈ X$ and $y > x$. Similarly, we say $f$ is monotone decreasing iff $f (y) ≤ f (x)$ whenever $x, y ∈ X$ and $y > x$, and strictly monotone decreasing iff $f (y) < f (x)$ whenever $x, y ∈ X$ and $y > x$. We say that $f$ is monotone if it is monotone increasing or monotone decreasing, and strictly monotone if it is strictly monotone increasing or strictly monotone decreasing.
