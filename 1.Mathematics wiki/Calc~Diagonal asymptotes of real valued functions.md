> [!quote] Theorem: Diagonal asymptotes of real valued functions
> Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be a function. The line $y=ax+b$ is a diagonal asymptote of $f$ if and only if $$ \lim_{ x \to +\infty } (f(x)-ax-b)=0 $$ Furthermore, $a$ and $b$ are given by $$ a=\lim_{ x \to +\infty } \frac{f(x)}{x} \hspace{1.5 cm} b= \lim_{ x \to +\infty } (f(x)-ax) $$
