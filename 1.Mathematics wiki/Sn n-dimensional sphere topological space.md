We generalize the topology of a $n$ dimensional sphere in $\mathbb R ^{n+1}$ as follows:

> [!quote] Definition: $(S^n,\Theta_{\mathbb R ^{n+1}})$
> Let $S^n$ be the set: $$S^n:=\left\{  (x_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n+1}: \sqrt{ \sum^{n+1}_{i=1} x_{i}^2 }=1  \right\}$$ And give it the subspace topology induced by $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ to form the topological space: $$(S^n, \Theta_{\mathbb R^{n+1}})$$

The reason why we denote it $S^n$ instead of $S^{n+1}$ comes from the fact that $S^n$ is always [[Homeomorphisms|homeomorphic]] to $\mathbb R^n$, even though it is induced by $\mathbb R ^{n+1}$.
