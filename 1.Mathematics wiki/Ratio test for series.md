> [!quote] Theorem: Ratio test

>1. If $\limsup_{ n \to \infty } \frac{\left| a_{n+1} \right|}{\left| a_{n} \right|}<1$, then the series $\sum^{\infty}_{n=m}a_{n}$ is absolutely convergent.
>2. If $\liminf_{ n \to \infty } \frac{\left| a_{n+1} \right|}{\left| a_{n} \right|}>1$, then the series $\sum^{\infty}_{n=m}a_{n}$ is divergent.
>3. In the remaining cases we can not assert any conclusion.

We will not prove it as it is a direct consequence of the [[Root test for series]] when considering the [[Root and ratio inequality of positive real sequences]].
