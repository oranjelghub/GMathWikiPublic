> [!quote] Theorem: Riemann series theorem
> Let $\sum^\infty_{n=0}a_n$ be a series which is conditionally convergent, but not absolutely convergent, and let $L\in {\mathbb R}$. Then there exists some permutation $\sigma$ on $\mathbb N$ such that $\sum^\infty_{n=0}a_{\sigma(n)}$ converges conditionally to $L$ 

Normally the full theorem also states that we can rearrange the series such that it diverges off to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$. We cover this case here: [[Properly divergent permutation of a series (Riemann series theorem)]]
