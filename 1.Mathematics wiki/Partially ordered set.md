> [!quote] Definition: Partially ordered set
> A relation $\leq_{X}$ is said to partially order the set $X$ if and only if 
> 1. (Reflexivity): $$\forall x\in X, x\leq_X x$$
> 2. (Anti-symmetry): $$\forall x,y \in X, x\leq_{X}y \land y\leq_{X}x \implies x=y$$
> 3. (Transitivity): $$\forall x,y,z\in X, x\leq_{X}y \land y\leq_{X}z \implies x\leq_{X}z$$

We also write $x<_{X}y$ if and only if $x\leq_{X} y\land x\neq y$.
