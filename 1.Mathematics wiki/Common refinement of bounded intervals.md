> [!quote] Definition: Common refinement of bounded intervals
> Let $I$ be a bounded interval and let $P$ and $P'$ be two partitions of $I$. We define the common refinement $P\#P'$ of $P$ and $P'$ as $$ P\#P':=\{ K\cap J: K\in P, J\in P' \} $$

Notice that $P\#P'$ is also a valid partition of $I$, and that in fact $$ P\#P' \preceq P \land P\#P' \preceq P' $$
