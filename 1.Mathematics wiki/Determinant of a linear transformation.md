> [!quote] Definition: Determinant of a linear transformation
> Let $F$ be a field, $V$ a finite dimensional $F$-vector space and $L:V \to V$ a linear transformation. If $\alpha$ if a basis of $V$ then we define the determinant of $L$ as $$ \det (L) := \det (L^{\alpha}_{\alpha}) $$

We can show that the determinant of a linear transformation is independent of choice of basis.
