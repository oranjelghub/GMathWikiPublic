Besides developing the [[General linear group]] we also define it's topology as follows:

> [!quote] Definition: Topology of the general linear group
> We define the topology of $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb R)$ by translating every element to it's ordered pair $(x_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n^{2}}$. We define the topological space as the one [[Subspace or induced topological spaces|induced]] by $\mathbb R^{n^2}$: $$(\text{GL}(n,\mathbb R), \Theta_{\mathbb R^{n^2}})$$
