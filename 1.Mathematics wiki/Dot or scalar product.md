We define a common [[Binary operations|binary operation]] for vectors called the dot or scalar product.

> [!quote] Notion: Dot or scalar product
> Given $v,w\in V$ where $V$ is a vector space over a field of the form $F^n$, we define the dot product as: $$(v_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}*(w_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}:=(v_i+w_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}$$

We say that the vectors $v$ and $w$ are orthogonal if and only if: $$v*w=O_V$$Where $O_V$ is the additive identity of the [[Vector spaces|vector space]].

Notice that the dot product satisfies enough properties in order for [[Perp(v)]] to be a vector space.
