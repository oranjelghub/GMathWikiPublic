> [!quote] Definition:
>  Let $F$ be a field, $V$ a finite dimensional $F$-vector space and $L:V \to V$ a linear transformation. If $\alpha$ if a basis of $V$ then we define the trace of $L$ as $$ \mathrm{Tr}(L)= \mathrm{Tr}(L^{\alpha}_{\alpha}) $$

We can show that the trace of $L$ is independent of the choice of basis.
