> [!quote] Theorem: Continuous function on $[a,b]$ are Riemann integrable
> Let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function, then $f$ is Riemann integrable.

>[!quote] Proof: Continuous function on $[a,b]$ are Riemann integrable
>The proof follows from the fact that $f$ is also uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$, and we know that uniformly continuous function on bounded intervals are Riemann integrable.
