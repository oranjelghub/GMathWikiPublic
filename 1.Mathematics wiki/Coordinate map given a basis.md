We generalize the notion of a coordinate system as follows:

> [!quote] Definition: Coordinates with respects to a basis
> Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $F$-vector space with basis $\beta=\{ v_{i} \}_{1\leq i\leq n}$. Then we define the coordinate map $\text{co}_{\beta}$ as $$ \text{co}_{\beta}:V\to F^{n}: v\mapsto (\lambda_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n} $$Where $(\lambda_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n}$ is the unique set of scalars such that $$ v=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\lambda_{i}v_{i} $$

This function is well defined per definition of a basis and dimension.
