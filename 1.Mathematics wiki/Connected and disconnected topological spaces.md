> [!quote] Definition:
> A topological space $(T,\tau)$ is said to be connected if and only if there don't exist any $U,U'\in \tau$ such that $$ U \cup U' = T \land U \cap U' = \emptyset $$If this isn't the case we say that $(T,\tau)$ is disconnected.

Note that when talking about some $K\subseteq T$, we may also talk about the connectedness of that subset by asking if $(K,\Theta_{T})$ is a connected topological space (where $(K,\Theta_{T})$ is the induced or subspace topology with respect to $T$).
