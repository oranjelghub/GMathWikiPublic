> [!quote] Definition: Differentiation of real valued functions
> Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ a function. Let $x_{0}\in X$ be a limit point of $X$, if the limit $$ \lim_{ x \to x_0:x\in X\backslash \{ x_{0} \} } \frac{f(x)-f(x_{0})}{x-x_{0}}  $$ Converges to some real number $L$, then we say that $f$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ and define $f'(x_{0}):=L$

If $f$ is differentiable over all the points of a set we say that it is differentiable over that set.
