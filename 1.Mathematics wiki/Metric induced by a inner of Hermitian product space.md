> [!quote] Definition: Metric induced by a inner of Hermitian product space
> Let $V$ be some inner or Hermitian product space with it's cannonical norm $\lvert \lvert \cdot \rvert \rvert$, then we define for all $x,y \in V$ the function $$ d(x,y)=\lvert \lvert x-y \rvert \rvert  $$Which can be verified to endow $V$ with a metric.

Proving $d$ is a metric can be done by properly proving the induced norm is indeed a norm and use the triangle inequality.
