Cycles are an alternative way of denoting bijections from a set to itself and thus an alternative definition or notation for the elements of [[Symmetric groups|$S_{\Omega}$]].

> [!quote] Definition: Cycle
> A cycle is an ordered pair: $$ (a_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n}: \sigma(a_{k})=a_{k+1} \land \sigma(a_{m})=a_{1}
$$ We call $m$ the length of the cycle.

Thus a cycle defines a part (or the entirety) of the mapping of a function in $S_{\Omega}$ and a function in $S_{\Omega}$ defines a set of cycles

Two cycles $(a_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n}$ and $(b_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n}$  are said to be disjoint if and only if: $$\nexists j:a_{j}=b_{j}$$We also have the following:

>[!quote] Basic consequences
>- $\sigma_{-1}=\left\{ (a^{1}_{m+1-i})_{1\leq i\leq n_{1}},\dots,(a^m_{m+1-i})_{1\leq i\leq n_{k}} \right\}$
>- Cycle composition is non-abelian
>- Disjoint cycles commute
