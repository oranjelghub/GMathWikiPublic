> [!quote] Definition: Ordering ideal
> Given some partially ordered set $X$ and some element $x\in X$, we define the ideal of $x$ as $$ (x):=\{ y\in X: y\leq_{X}x \} $$

In addition we usually also define $$ (X):=\{ (x): x\in X \} $$
>[!quote] Theorem: Ideal map
>The ideal map $f$ defined as $$f:X\to (X): x\mapsto (x)$$ Is a bijection, furthermore $$\forall x,y\in X,  x\leq_{X} y \iff f(x) \subseteq f(y) $$
