> [!quote] Theorem: Cardinality of a set of free vectors is less then or equal to the cardinality of a set of spanning vectors
> Let $V$ be some $F$-vector space. If $U$ is a collection of linearly independent vectors and $W$ is a collection of vectors spanning $V$, then $$ \left| U \right| \leq \left| W \right|  $$

This is a basic consequence of the Steinitz lemma. This theorem not being true would directly contradict the lemma.
