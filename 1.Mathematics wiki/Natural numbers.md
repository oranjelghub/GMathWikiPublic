> [!quote] Definition: Natural numbers
> Let $\mathbb{N}$ denote the unique set satisfying the Peano axioms. We call this set the set of natural numbers.

There are two implicit assumptions to this definition:
1. $\mathbb{N}$ is unique up to morphism
2. There is some set $\mathbb{N}$ satisfying the Peano axioms
