We define the morphism class of the [[Category]] [[Group (category)|group]].

> [!quote] Definition:
> Given a group $(G,\circ_{G})$ and a group $(H,\circ_{H})$ we define a homomorphism as: $$ \varphi: G \to H\hspace{2cm}\land \hspace{2cm}\varphi(a\circ_{G} b)=\varphi(a)\circ_{H}\varphi (b)
$$

We often also write the second condition as: $\varphi(ab)=\varphi(a)\varphi(b)$, and call $\varphi$ operation preserving.
