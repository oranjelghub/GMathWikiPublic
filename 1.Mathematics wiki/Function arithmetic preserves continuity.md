> [!quote] Theorem: Function arithmetic preserves continuity
> Let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, and let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be functions. Let $x_0 \in X$. Then if $f$ and $g$ are both continuous at $x_0$, then the functions $f + g$, $f − g$, $\max( f, g)$, $\min( f, g)$ and $f g$ are also continuous at $x_0$. If $g$ is non-zero on $X$, then $\frac{f}{g}$ is also continuous at $x_0$.

The proof of this follows from the limit laws of limits at a point and from the equivalence with the sequential definition of continuity.
