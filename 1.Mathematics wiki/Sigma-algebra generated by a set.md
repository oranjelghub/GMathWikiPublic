>[!quote] Proof: Sigma-algebra generated by a set
>Suppose that a sigma algebra $\sigma(C)$ that satisfies these properties exists, then clearly it is unique by the second property. To prove such a sigma algebra exists consider the set $\mathbb{E}$ defined by $$ \mathbb{E}=\{ \sigma \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(C)) \mid \sigma\text{ is a sigma algebra on }\Omega \land C \subset \sigma \} $$Now define $$ \sigma(C) = \bigcap_{\sigma \in \mathbb{E}}\sigma $$We argue that $\sigma(C)$ is a sigma algebra satisfying those properties. It is first of all very clear that $\sigma(C)$ is a sigma algebra, since clearly $\Omega \in \sigma(C)$ and if $A \in \sigma(C)$ then $A$ is per definition in every $\sigma$ in $\mathbb{E}$, which implies $A^{c}$ is in every $\sigma$ in $\mathbb{E}$ so we can conclude that $A^{c}\in\sigma(C)$. A similar argument can be made for the union of sets in $\sigma(C)$. Suppose now we have some other sigma algebra $\sigma'$ such that $C\subseteq \sigma'$, then clearly $\sigma(C)\subseteq \sigma'$ since $\sigma'\in \mathbb{E}$ per definition. Thus $\sigma(C)$ satisfies all the properties.
