Small note concerning some big basics. 

Frist of all since all the entries of the associated sequence are positive we have that $$ S_{N}\leq S_{N+1} $$ Thus if we want the series to be convergent we only need the sequence of partial sums to be bounded as it would satisfy the conditions discussed here: [[Monotone bounded sequences converge]].
