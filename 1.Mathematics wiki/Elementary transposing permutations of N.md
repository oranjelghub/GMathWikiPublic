> [!quote] Definition: Elementary transposing permutations of $\mathbb{N}_{\leq n}^{*}$
> Let $\tau_{e}$ be a transposition and $\sigma$ a permutation of $\mathbb{N}^{*}_{\leq n}$ for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we say that $\tau_{e}$ is a elementary transposition with respect to $\sigma$ if and only if it transposes $\sigma(i)$ and $\sigma(j)$ with $$ \left| \sigma(i)-\sigma(j) \right| =1 $$
