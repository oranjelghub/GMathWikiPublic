> [!quote] Definition: Series on countable sets
> Let $X$ be a countable set and $f$ a function $X\to \mathbb{R}$. We say the series $\sum^{}_{x\in X}f(x)$ is absolutely convergent if and only if for some bijection $g:\mathbb{N}\to X$ the sum $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}f(g(n))$ is absolutely convergent. We then define $$ \sum^{}_{x\in X}f(x)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}f(g(n)) $$

To assert that this is well defined and that the choice of $g$ doesn't matter we can use the fact that absolutely convergent series can be rearranged by some bijection. See: [[Rearrangement of absolutely converging series]]
