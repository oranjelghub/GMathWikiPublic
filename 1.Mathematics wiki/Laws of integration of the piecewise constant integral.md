> [!quote] Theorem: Laws of integration of the piecewise constant integral
> Let $I$ be a bounded integral and let $f:I\to \mathbb{R}$ and $g:I\to \mathbb{R}$ be piecewise constant functions on $I$. Then
> - $\text{p.c.} \int_I f+g= \text{p.c.} \int_I f +\text{p.c.} \int_Ig$
> - For $c\in \mathbb{R}$ we have $\text{p.c.} \int_I cf= c\left( \text{p.c.} \int_If \right)$
> - For $f(x)\geq g(x)$ for all $x\in I$, we have $\text{p.c.} \int_I f\geq \text{p.c.} \int_I g$
> - If $f$ is the constant function $f(x)=k$ for all $x\in I$, then $\text{p.c.} \int_I f= k\mu (I)$
> - Suppose $\{ J,K \}$ is a partition of $I$ into two intervals $J$ and $K$. Then $f|_{J}$ and $f|_{K}$ are both piecewise constant with respect to their domain and $\text{p.c.} \int_I f= \text{p.c.} \int_J f|_{J}+\text{p.c.} \int_Kf|_{K}$
