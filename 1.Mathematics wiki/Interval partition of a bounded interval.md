> [!quote] Definition: Interval partition of a bounded interval
> Let $I$ be a bounded interval and let $P\subseteq \mathcal{P}(I)$ be finite, we say $P$ is a interval partition of $I$ if and only if every element $A\in P$ is a bounded interval, $\bigcup P=I$ and if $A,B\in P$ then $A\cap B=\emptyset$.
