> [!quote] Definition: Norm in a inner or Hermitian product space
> Let $V$ be a inner or Hermitian product space. We define the function $\lvert \lvert \cdot \rvert \rvert: V \to \mathbb{R}$ as $$ \forall v\in V: \lvert \lvert v \rvert \rvert := \sqrt{ \langle v , v \rangle  }   $$

We can prove this is a norm on $V$ and that it makes of $V$ a normed vector space by using Cauchy-Schwarz. We call this the norm induced by $V$ or $V$'s cannonical norm.
