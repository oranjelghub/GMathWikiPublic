> [!quote] Definition: Algebraic and geometric multiplicity of a eigenvalue
> Let $V$ be a $n$-dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-vector space and $L:V\to V$ a linear transformation. If $\lambda\in \text{Spec}(L)$ we define the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda$ as the biggest $m(\lambda)\in \mathbb{N}^{*}$ such that $$ \varphi_{L}(x)=(x-\lambda)^{m(\lambda)}P_{n-m(\lambda)}(x) $$ where $P_{n-m(\lambda)}(x)$ is a polynomial of degree ${n-m(\lambda)}$ where we can not factor out another $(x-\lambda)$ term. On the other hand we define the geometric multiplicity of $\lambda$ as $d(\lambda)$ where $$ d(\lambda)=\dim E_{\lambda} $$
