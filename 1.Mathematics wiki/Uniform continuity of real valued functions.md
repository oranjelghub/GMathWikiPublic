> [!quote] Notion: Uniform continuity of real valued functions
> Let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and let $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ be a function. We say $f$ is uniformly continuous on $X$ if and only if $$ \forall \varepsilon>0 \; \exists \delta>0: \forall x,y\in X, \; \left| x-y \right| \leq \delta \implies \left| f(x)-f(y) \right| \leq \varepsilon $$

Notice that there is no such thing as "pointwise uniform continuity". It is also obvious that this notion implies standard continuity and also that it is preserved under composition.
