Generalization: %%_Abstractions of `object`/`notion`._%%

Properties: %%_Statements regarding `object` or necessary conditions of `notion`._%%

> [!quote] Notion:
> Given two topologies $\tau$ and $\tau'$ on a given set $T$, if we have $\tau \subset \tau'$ we say $\tau'$ is finer than $\tau$ whilst $\tau$ is coarser than $\tau'$. We say they are comparable if we can make either of two statements.
