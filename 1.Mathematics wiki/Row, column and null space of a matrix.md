> [!quote] Definition: Row, column and null space of a matrix
> Let $A\in M_{n\times m}(F)$ be a matrix with the rows $(R_{i})_{1\leq i \leq n}$ and columns $(C_{i})_{1\leq i\leq m}$ then we define the row space $R(A)$ of $A$ as $$ R(A):=\text{span}\{ R_{i} \}_{1\leq i\leq n} $$and the column space $C(A)$ as $$ C(A):= \text{span}\{ C_{i} \}_{1\leq i\leq m} $$Furthermore we also define the null space $N(A)$ of $A$ as $$ N(A):=\{ X\in \mathbb{R}^{m}:AX=0 \} $$
