If a function does $f$ does mappings using the discrete or indiscrete topology we can say the following:

> [!quote] Theorem: Continuity of maps involving the discrete and indiscrete topology
> Given the topological spaces $(D,\mathcal P(D))$ and $(I,\{ I,\emptyset \})$, a function $f: X\to Y$ is always continuous if:
> 1. $X=D$ with $(D,\mathcal P(D))$
> 2. $Y=I$ with $(I,\{ I,\emptyset \})$
