> [!quote] Definition: Linear map
> A linear map is a function $L$ from a vector space $V$ to a vector space $W$, both which are defined over a [[Fields|field]] $F$, that satisfies:$$ \begin{align}  L(v+w)&=L(v)+L(w)\\ L(av)&=aL(v) \end{align}
$$Or simply: $$ L(av+bw)=aL(v)+bL(w)
$$

If $T$ is [[Functions|bijective]] we say that $T$ is a [[Isomorphisms|isomorphism]] between vector spaces and if $V=W$ then we say that $T$ is a linear transformation.
