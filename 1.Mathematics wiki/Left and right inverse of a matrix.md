> [!quote] Definition: Right and left inverse of a matrix
> Let $A\in M_{p\times n}(F)$ and $B\in M_{n\times p}(F)$, we say that $B$ is the left inverse of $A$ if and only if $$ BA=\mathbb{I}_{n} $$We define the right inverse of $A$ symetrically.

If $B$ is the left and right inverse of $A$, then we say that $B$ is the inverse of $A$ and denote $$ B=A^{-1} $$
