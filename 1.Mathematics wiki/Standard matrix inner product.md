> [!quote] Definition: Standard matrix inner product
> Let $(M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{R}),\mathbb{R},+)$ be the standard matrix vector space over $\mathbb{R}$. Then we define the standard matrix inner product of two matrices $A,B \in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ as $$ \langle A , B \rangle = \mathrm{Tr}(AB^{T}) $$

Which, by using the basic properties of the trace, can be verified to form a valid inner product on $M_{m \times n}(\mathbb{R})$.
