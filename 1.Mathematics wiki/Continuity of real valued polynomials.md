> [!quote] Theorem: Continuity of real valued polynomials
> Let $n ≥ 0$ be an integer, and for each $0 ≤ i ≤ n$ let $c_i$ be a real number. Let $P : \mathbb{R} → \mathbb{R}$ be the function $$P(x):= \sum^{n}_{i=0}c_{i}x^{i} $$ Then $P$ is continuous over $\mathbb{R}$.

This is a basic consequence of the limit laws of real valued functions and the continuity of $x^{n}$. Under another angle, it is a basic consequence of the continuity being preserved under function composition.
