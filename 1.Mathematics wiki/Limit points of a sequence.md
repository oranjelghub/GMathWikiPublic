In order to speak of converging like behavior without having proper convergence we define a notion of a limit point of a sequence.

> [!quote] Notion: Limit point of a sequence
> $l$ is said to be a limit point of the sequence $(a_n)^\infty_{n=m}$ if and only if: $$\forall \varepsilon,\forall N, \exists n:n\geq N\land d(a_n,l)\leq\varepsilon$$

One of the basic properties of limit points is the following:

>[!quote] Proposition: Limit of a sequence is the only limit point
>$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}a_n=l\implies l\;\text{is the only limit point of}\;(a_n)^\infty_{n=m}$$

Which we prove [[Limit of a sequence is the only limit point (Proof)|here]].
