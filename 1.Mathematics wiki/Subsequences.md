> [!quote] Definition: Subsequence
> Given two sequences $(a_n)^\infty_{n=0}$ and $(b_n)^\infty_{n=0}$ we say that $(b_n)^\infty_{n=0}$ is a subsequence of $(a_n)^\infty_{n=0}$ iff $$\exists f:\mathbb N \to \mathbb N$$ such that $$f(n)<f(n+1) \land \forall n\in \mathbb N, b_{n}=a_{f(n)}$$

This notion of subsequencing can be checked to form a transitive and reflexive relation.
