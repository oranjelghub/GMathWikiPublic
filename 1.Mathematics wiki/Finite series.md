To talk about repeated addition and later about infinite convergent addition we develop a notion of series.

> [!quote] Definition: Finite series
> Let $m$;$n$ be integers and let $(a_n)^\infty_{n=m}$ be a sequence of real numbers. Then we define the finite sum as follows:
> $$\begin{align}  \sum^{n}_{i=m}a_{i}&:=0\;\text{if}\; n<m\\ \sum^{n+1}_{i=m}a_{i} &:= a_{n+1} + \sum^{n}_{i=m}a_{i}\;\text{if}\; n\geq m-1         \end{align}$$
