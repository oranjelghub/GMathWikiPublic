> [!quote] Notion: Topology of $\mathbb Z$ induced by $\mathbb R$
> The topology of the integers is defined as the subspace topology induced by $\mathbb R$: $$(\mathbb Z, \Theta_{\mathbb R})$$ Notice that $\{ n \}=\mathbb Z \cap \left( n-\frac{1}{2},n+\frac{1}{2} \right)$ and that thus $\mathbb R$ induces the discrete topology on $\mathbb Z$: $$(\mathbb Z, \mathcal P(\mathbb Z))$$

We say that the integers form a discrete space.
