Dual to the [[Convergence of sequences]], we define a notion of limits:

> [!quote] Notion: Limit of a sequence
> If we have a convergent [[Sequences|sequence]] that converges to $L$ we say that the limit of $a_n$ as $n$ approaches infinity is $L$ and denote: $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}a_n=L$$

We also have that a limit is [[Uniqueness of limits of sequences|unique]].
