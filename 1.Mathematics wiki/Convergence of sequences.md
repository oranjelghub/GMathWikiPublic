Given a [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $(X,d)$, we can develop a notion of convergence:

> [!quote] Notion: Convergence of a sequence
> A [[Sequences|sequence]] $(a_n)^\infty_{n=k}$ is said to converge to $L$ if and only if $$\forall \varepsilon \exists N: \forall n\geq N: d(a_n,L)\leq \varepsilon$$

Note that $L$ is [[Uniqueness of limits of sequences|unique]] if $a_n$ converges and that in order to speak of convergence we must have $L\in X$ (see: [[Completeness of metric spaces]]).
