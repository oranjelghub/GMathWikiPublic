> [!quote] Definition: Function
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets, and let $R$ be a relation on $X\times Y$ such that for every $x\in X$ there exists exactly one $y\in Y$ for which $$ (x,y)\in R $$We then write $$ f:X\to Y: x\mapsto f(x) $$

We define function equality as

>[!quote] Definition: Function equality
>We define two functions $f,g:X\rightarrow Y$ with the same domain and range to be equal if and only if $\forall x\in X:f(x)=g(x)$.
