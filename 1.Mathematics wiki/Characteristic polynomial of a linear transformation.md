> [!quote] Definition: Characteristic polynomial of a linear transformation
> Let $F$ be a field, $V$ a finite dimensional $F$-vector space and $L:V \to V$ a linear transformation. If $\alpha$ if a basis of $V$ then we define the characteristic polynomial of $L$ as $$ \varphi_{L}(x):=\varphi_{L^{\alpha}_{\alpha}}(x) $$

We can show that the characteristic polynomial of a linear transformation is independent of choice of basis.
