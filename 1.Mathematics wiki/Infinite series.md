> [!quote] Definition: Infinite series
> A infinite series is formally speaking a series of the form $$ \sum^{\infty}_{n=m}a_{n} $$ Where we define $$ \sum^{\infty}_{n=m} a_{n}:=\lim_{ N \to \infty } \sum^{N}_{n=m} a_{n} =\lim_{ N \to \infty }S_{N} $$ Where $S_{N}$ denotes the $N$'th partial sum. If the sequence $(S_n)^\infty_{n=m}$ is divergent we leave the series undefined.

Since the limit of a sequence is unique we also have that the infinite sums denote a unique value, in the sense that there is no confusion when speaking of THE sum $L=\sum^{\infty}_{n=m}a_{n}$.
