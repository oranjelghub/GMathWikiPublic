Using the notion of [[Least upper bounds]] we can develop the definition of supremum.

> [!quote] Notion: Supremum
> Given $E\subseteq \mathbb R$, we define the supremum of $E$, $\text{sup}(E)$, to be equal to:
> 1. The least upper bound of $E$
> 2. $+\infty$ if $E$ has no upper bound and is non-empty
> 3. $-\infty$ if $E$ has no upper bound and is empty

Dual to this notion is the notion of infimum, which one may describe as the greatest lower bound. One can easily show that: $$-M=\text{inf}(-E )\land -\text{sup}(E)=\text{inf}(-E)$$
