We define [[Addition|addition]] on the natural numbers as a [[Binary operations|binary operation]] and a recursion.

> [!quote] Notion: Addition on $\mathbb N$
> $$0+m:=m$$
> $$S(n)+m:=S(n+m)$$

With this definition we can develop an algebra and discuss properties of addition in $\mathbb N$.

> [!quote] Proposition: Properties of recursive addition in $\mathbb N$
> 1. $n+0=n$
> 2. $n+S(m)=S(n+m)$
> 3. $n+m=m+n$ (Commutativity)
> 4. $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ (Associativity)
> 5. $a+b=a+c\implies b=a$ (Cancelation law)
