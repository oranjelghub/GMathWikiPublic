> [!quote] Definition: Characteristic polynomial of a matrix
> Let $A \in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ be a matrix, we define the characteristic polynomial $\varphi_{A}$ as the function $$ \varphi_{A}: \mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}: z \mapsto \det(z\mathbb{I}_{n}-A) $$

A similar definition can be made for linear transformations $L:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ by considering the associated L-matrix. Note also that the eigenvalues of $A$ are specifically the roots of $\varphi_{A}$.
