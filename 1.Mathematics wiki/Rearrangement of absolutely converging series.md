> [!quote] Theorem: Rearrangement of absolutely convergent series
> Let $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}a_{n}$ be a absolutely convergent series, and let $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a bijection. Then the series $\sum^{\infty}_{m=0}a_{f(m)}$ is also absolutely convergent and in fact we have $$ \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}a_{n}=\sum^{\infty}_{m=0}a_{f(m)} $$

We can actually relax the condition of $f$ being bijective by stating that $f$ must be strictly increasing. This wil preserve the absolute convergence of the rearranged series but will lose the exact limit of the normal series in the process. See: [[Rearrangement of absolutely converging series with strictly increasing functions]]
