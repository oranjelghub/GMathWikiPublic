> [!quote] Notion: Sequential definition of limit of a function at a point
>   Let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, let $f : X → \mathbb{R}$ be a function, let $E$ be a subset of $X$, $x_0$ be an adherent point of $E$, and let $L$ be a real number. We say that $f$ converges to $L$ at $x_0$ in $E$ and write $\lim_{x→x_0 ;x\in E} f (x) = L$, iff for every $(a_n)^\infty_{n=0}$ which consists entirely of elements of $E$ and converges at $x_{0}$, the sequence $(f(a_n))^\infty_{n=0}$ converges to $L$.

This definition can be proven to be equivalent to the classic one ([[Limit of a real valued function at a point]]), which we do here: [[Equivalence between the sequential and the classic definition of the limit of a function at a point]] (This requires choice)
