> [!quote] Definition: Piecewise constant real valued functions
> Let $I$ be a bounded interval, let $f:I\to \mathbb{R}$ be a function and let $P$ be a partition of $I$. We say that $f$ is piecewise constant on $I$ if and only if there exists a partition $P$ of $I$ such that $$ \forall J\in P \exists c\in \mathbb{R}: j\in J\implies f(j)=c $$ We then also say that $f$ is piecewise constant with respect to $P$.

It follows that if we haver a finer partition $P'\preceq P$, then $f$ is also piecewise constant with respect to $P'$.
