> [!quote] Definition: Fields
> A triplet $(F,+,*)$, where $+:F\times F\to F$ and $*:F\times F:\to F$ are binary operations on $F$, is said to be a field if and only if 
> - $(F,+)$ forms a abelian group
> - $(F\backslash\{ 0 \},*)$ forms a abelian group
> - $*$ is distributive over $+$, i.e. $a*(b+c)=(a*b)+(a*c)$
