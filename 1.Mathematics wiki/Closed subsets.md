Using the notion of [[Adherent points]] we can develop a notion of closed subsets, which intuitively are sets that contain their own "border".

> [!quote] Definition: Closed subset
>Given a subset $Y$ of a metric space $X$, $Y$ is said to be closed in $X$ if and only if: $$\bar Y=Y$$

From this definition we can derive the following properties:

>[!quote] Notion: Properties of closed subsets
>1. $\bar{\bar Y}=\bar Y$
>2. A subset $Y$ of a [[Metric spaces|metric space]] $X$ is closed if and only if $Y^c$ is open.
>3. The intersection of any family of closed sets is closed.
>4. The union of any family of closed sets is closed.

Which are all pretty straight forward to prove and can be found in the book "Introduction to topology" by Gamelin and Greene.
