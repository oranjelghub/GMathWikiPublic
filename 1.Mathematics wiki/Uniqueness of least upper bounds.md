We state the following basic theorem concerning [[Least upper bounds]]:

> [!quote] Theorem: Uniqueness of least upper bounds
> $$\forall S\subseteq \mathbb R, \exists! M: M\;\text{is a least upper bound of}\;E$$

Which we shall prove here:

>[!quote] Proof: Uniqueness of least upper bounds
>Suppose we had two least upper bounds $M_1$, $M_2$ for a subset $E$. Since they are both least upper bounds we must have $M_1\leq M_2$ and $M_2\leq M_1$, but this implies that $M_1=M_2$
