> [!quote] Definition: Determinant of a matrix (explicit permutative definition)
> The determinant of a $n\times n$ matrix over some field $F$ is given by the fuction $$  \det:M_{n\times n}(F)\to F :A\mapsto \det(A)=\sum^{}_{\sigma\in S_{n}} \left( \text{sgn}(\sigma)\prod_{1\leq i\leq n}a_{i\sigma(i)} \right) $$

Note that this definition satisfies all the requirements of the implicit definition.
