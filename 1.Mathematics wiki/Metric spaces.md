A metric space is defined as follows:

> [!quote] Definition: Metric space
> A metric space $(X,d)$ is a [[Sets|set]] $X$ endowed with a [[Metric|metric]] $d$ on $X$.

If $(X,d)$ is a metric space we can also define a notion of subspace:

>[!quote] Definition: Subspace of a metric space
>Given a metric space $(X,d)$, a metric space $(Y,d')$ is a subspace of that metric space if and only if $Y\subseteq X$ and $d'$ is a [[Partial functions|partial function]] of $[0,+\infty)^{X^2}$ with domain $Y^2$.
