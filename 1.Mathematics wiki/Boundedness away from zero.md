We develop a notion of boundedness away from zero in order to construct proper reciprocation in [[Real numbers]].

> [!quote] Notion: Boundedness away from zero
> A sequence of [[Rational numbers|rational numbers]] $(a_n)^\infty_{n=1}$ is said to be bounded away from zero if and only if: $$\exists c:\forall n\geq 1:|a_n|\geq c$$

Like this we can show that [[Proof of the away from zero boundedness of non zero reals|every non zero real number is bounded away from zero]].
