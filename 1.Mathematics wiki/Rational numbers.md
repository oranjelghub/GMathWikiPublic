Informally we define the set of rationals to be the following set:

> [!quote] Definition: Informal rational numbers
> $$\mathbb{Q}:=\{\frac{a}{b}:a\in \mathbb{Z}\land b\in \mathbb{N}^*\}$$

More formally the rationals can be constructed from the [[Integers|integers]].

>[!quote] Definition: Rational numbers
>A rational number is an expression of the form $a// b$, where $a//b$ represents the following [[Sets|set]].
  $$a//b:=\{(a,b)\in \mathbb{N^2}:(a,b)\sim(c,d)\}$$

Notice that $//$ is [[Scaffolding]] notion that can be discarded once [[Division of the rational numbers]] is defined because we can show the notions are equivalent. In the above definition $\sim$  also denotes the following [[Equivalence relations|equivalence relation]]: $$ad=bc$$
We don't consider $a//0$ to be a rational number.

We can then define the following [[Group isomorphism|isomorphism]] between the [[Integers]] and the rationals in the fully extend the [[Rational numbers]]: $$n \equiv n//1$$
