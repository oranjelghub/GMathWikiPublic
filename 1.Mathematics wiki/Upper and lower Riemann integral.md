> [!quote] Definition: Upper and lower Riemann integral
> Let $f:I\to \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded function on some bounded interval $I$. We define the upper Riemann integral $\overline {\int}_{I}f$ as $$ \overline {\int}_{I} f:=\inf \left\{  \text{p.c.} \int_{I} g: g \text{ is a piecewise constant function on }I\text{ which majorizes }f  \right\} $$and the lower Riemann integral $\underline {\int}_{I}f$ as $$ \underline {\int}_{I} f:=\sup\left\{  \text{p.c.} \int_{I} g: g \text{ is a piecewise constant function on }I\text{ which minorizes }f \right\} $$
