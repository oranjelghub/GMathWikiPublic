We encapsulate the notion of amounts of elements within a set with the definition of cardinality

> [!quote] Notion: Cardinality of a set
> We say $S$ has cardinality $n$ if and only if there exists a bijection $f:S\to \{ 1,\dots,n \}\subset\mathbb N$

If this bijection exists we say that $S$ is finite. If it doesn't, there may still be a bijection between $S$ and  $\mathbb N$.

>[!quote] Definition: Uncountable sets
>If $S$ has a bijection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$ we say $S$ is countable and write: $$\text{Card}(S)=\aleph_{0}$$

If such bijection still doesn't exist, we say $S$ is uncountable.

Notice that we can construct a [[Equivalence relations|equivalence relation]] construct out of sharing equal cardinality: [[Equivalent cardinality relation]]
