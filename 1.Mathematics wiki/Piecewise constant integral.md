> [!quote] Definition: Piecewise constant integral
> Let $I$ be a bounded interval, and let $f:I\to \mathbb{R}$ be a piecewise constant function on $I$. Then we define the piecewise constant integral $$ \text{p.c.}\int_{I} f := \sum^{}_{J\in P}c_{J} \mu(J) $$ Where $P$ is some partition such that $f$ is piecewise constant with respect to $P$, and where $c_{J}$ denotes the constant value of $f$ on $J$ and $\mu(J)$ the length of $J$.
