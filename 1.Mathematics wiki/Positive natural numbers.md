A [[Natural numbers|natural number]] is said to be positive if and only if:

> [!quote] Definition: Positive natural numbers
> $a$ is positive $\iff a\in \mathbb N \land a\neq 0$

We can apply the [[ZF-axioms|axiom of specification]] to the [[Sets|set]] of [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]] to create the set of positive natural numbers:$$\mathbb N^+=\{n\in \mathbb N:n\;\text{is positive}\}$$Under addition this definition leads to various properties in relation to [[Addition of the natural numbers|addition]].

> [!quote] Proposition: Properties of positive natural numbers
> 1. $a\neq 0\land a,b\in \mathbb N\implies a+b\;\text{is positive}$
> 2. $a,b\in \mathbb N\land a+b=0\iff a,b=0$
> 3. $a\in \mathbb N^{+}\implies \exists! b:S(b)=a$
