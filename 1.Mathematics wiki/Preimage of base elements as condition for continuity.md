> [!quote] Theorem: Preimage of base elements as condition for continuity
> Given $f:S\to T$ with both being topological spaces and $T$ having basis $\mathcal{B}$, if for all $B\in \mathcal B$, $f^{-1}(B)$ is open in $S$, then $f$ is continuous.

The proof simply relies on the fact that $$f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{B\in \mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{B}} B\right)=\bigcup_{B\in \mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{B}} f^{-1}(B)$$
