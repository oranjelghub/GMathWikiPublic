> [!quote] Notion: Sequential definition of uniform continuity of real valued functions
> Let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ a function. We say that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $X$ if and only if given two equivalent sequences $(x_n)^\infty_{n=0}$ and $(y_n)^\infty_{n=0}$ consisting only of elements of $X$ we have that $(f(x_{n}))^\infty_{n=0}$ and $(f(y_{n}))^\infty_{n=0}$ are also equivalent sequences.

One can prove that the classic definition is equivalent to the sequential one: [[Equivalence between the sequential and the classic definition of uniform continuity of real valued functions]]
