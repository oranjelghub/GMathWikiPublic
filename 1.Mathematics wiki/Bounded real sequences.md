We develop a notion of bounded real sequences as follows:

> [!quote] Notion: Real bounded sequence
> A sequence of real numbers $(a_n)^\infty_{n=m}$ is said to be bounded if and only if: $$\exists M:\forall n\geq m:|a_n|\leq M$$

We can easily check this definition is consistent with the one in [[Bounded rational sequences]].
