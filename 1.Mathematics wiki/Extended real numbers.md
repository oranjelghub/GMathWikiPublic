We define the set of extended [[Real numbers|real numbers]] as follows:

> [!quote] Definition: Extended real numbers
> $$\bar{\mathbb R}=\mathbb R\cup\{-\infty,+\infty\}$$

A extended real number is said to be finite if and only if $x\neq -\infty\land x\neq+\infty$, otherwise $x$ is said to be infinite.

We also define the following negations:$$\begin{align} -(+\infty):=-\infty\\ -(-\infty)=+\infty \end{align}$$

**_Remark_**: This note doesn't say anything about how the infinite elements should behave, if no algebra/ordering/properties are defined on the infinites then they are just meaningless symbols that behave like dummy variables.
