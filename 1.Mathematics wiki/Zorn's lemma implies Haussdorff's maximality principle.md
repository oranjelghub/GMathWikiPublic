> [!quote] Proof: Zorn's lemma implies Haussdorff's maximality principle
> We define $$ \Omega :=\{ Y \subseteq X: Y\text{ is totally ordered} \} $$
> Consider $(\Omega, \subseteq)$, take any totally ordered subset $T\subseteq \Omega$, notice that this subset is bounded above by $\bigcup T$. Thus by Zorn's lemma there exists some maximal element in $\Omega$. In other words Haussdorff's maximality principle holds.
