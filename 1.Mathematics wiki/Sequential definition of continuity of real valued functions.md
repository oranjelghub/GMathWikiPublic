> [!quote] Notion: Sequential definition of continuity of real valued functions
> Given $X\subseteq \mathbb{R} \}$ and a function $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$, $f$ is said to be continuous at some point $x_{0}\in X$ if and only if for every sequence $(x_n)^\infty_{n=m}$ consisting of elements of $X$ that converges to $x_{0}$, we have that $$ \lim_{ n \to \infty } f(x_{n})=f(x_{0}) $$

In other words the limit exists and is equal to $f(x_{0})$.

This definition is equivalent to the classic one by: [[Equivalence between the sequential and the classic definition of continuity of real valued functions]]
