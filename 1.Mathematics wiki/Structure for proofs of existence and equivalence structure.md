Suppose we have an object $a$. We want to prove that it's exists and has a well defined equality. In the graph below, $\mathcal P$ denotes a proof, $\varepsilon$ denotes an equivalence relation and $\psi$ denoted a formal object form or in other words an object whose well defined existence has already been asserted.

**_DISCLAIMER_**: This note just exists as a reminder of how we define the things classically but isn't a very formal description. Note that it might be a bit inconsistent or just plain wrong. Let the purpose of this note just be gaining some insight and being a reminder, not an actual source for learning when and what to prove. Use at your own risk.
