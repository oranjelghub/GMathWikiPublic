Let $m$ be an [[Integers|integer]], then we can define a sequence $(a_n)^\infty_m$ as follows:

> [!quote] Definition: Sequence
> A sequence $(a_n)^\infty_{n=m}$ of elements of $X$ is a [[Functions|function]] from $\{n\in\mathbb Z:n\geq m\}$ to $X$. $$f:\{n\in \mathbb Z :n\geq m\}\rightarrow X:n\mapsto a_n$$
