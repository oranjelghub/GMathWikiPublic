> [!quote] Definition:
> Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $X\to \mathbb{R}$ be a function. Let $x_{0}\in X$, we say that $f$ attains a local maximum in $x_{0}$ if and only if there exists some $\delta$ such that $f|_{[x_{0}-\delta,x_{0}+\delta]}$ attains a maximum in $x_{0}$. Similarly we say that $f$ attains a local minimum if and only if there exists some $\delta$ such that $f|_{[x_{0}-\delta,x_{0}+\delta]}$ attains a minimum in $x_{0}$
