A compiler translates the pythonscrypt into python bytecode. An interpreter then translates the python bytecode as binary code. Which is then sent to the CPU.

When defining a variable, python will store the variable in the RAM when running the program. Variables are declared straight up by defining them with a "$=$".

Variables types:
- Int or integers: They are whole numbers
- Float: Decimal numbers, in order to refer to a integer as a floating number we can define our variable as $$ d=1.0 $$
- Strings: They are bits of text, we can sum these variables in python, which means the strings get attached one to another

Types of errors:
- Syntax errors: An error in the syntax of the code
- Execution error: An error in the execution of the code itself, will usually cause a crash
- Logical error: An error in the reasoning which is correctly coded

Potential exam question: **Explain the difference between a logical error and a syntax error**
