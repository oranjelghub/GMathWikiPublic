In order to describe movement of objects we use the center of mass as tracker for the movement and origin of outgoing forces.

To calculate the vector of the center of mass given two vectors, we calculate $$ \vec{r}_{G}=\frac{m_{a}\vec{a}+m_{b}\vec{b}}{m_{a}+m_{b}} $$This lecture was very hard and the notes are contained on paper.
