>[!quote] First law
>_The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with a star at one of the two foci._
>
>This means that the distance of the planet to the star is described by $$ r=\frac{a(1-e)}{1+e\cos(\theta)} $$Where $e=\sqrt{ 1-\frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}} }$ and $a$ and $b$ are the constant representing the analytical ellipse describing the planets motion ($\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$).

>[!quote] Second law
>**Please refer to a physical drawing**

>[!quote] Third law
> $$ \left( \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}} \right)^{2}=\left( \frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}} \right)^{3} $$Where $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are the periods of the planets orbiting around some star and $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are the entire lengths of the semi-major axis of the ellipse describing their movement.
