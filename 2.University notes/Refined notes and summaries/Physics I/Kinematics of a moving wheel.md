Let us imagine a moving wheel with radius $R$, that moves at some speed $v$ in a fixed direction. We want to describe the kinematics of some point $p$ on this wheel, in order to do that, we will mainly just have to find a vector that represents that point at any time $t$.

To do this we consider the galilean transformation between the coordinate system with origin in the wheel (which is a moving coordinate system) and the coordinate system with origin in the position where the movement is being observed. The galilean vector is given by $$ \vec{G}=vt\hat{i}+R\hat{j} $$Whilst the vector from the origin of the wheel to the point $p$ is given by $$ \vec{p}_{w}=R\sin(\omega t)\hat{i}+R\cos(\omega t)\hat{j} $$With some angular speed $\omega$, which we can use to rewrite $v$ as $R\omega$ and obtain $$ \vec{p}=\vec{p}_{w}+\vec{G}= R(\omega t+\sin(\omega t))+R(1+\cos(\omega t))\hat{j} $$
