Suppose we have two bodies with mass $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ which are at a distance $r$. According to Newton they attract each other with a force given by $$ {F}_{G}= G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}$$Where $G$ is the gravitational constant. In vector notation we have to keep in mind where our vector originates from. We choose one body and study the attraction of some second body to that first body. If we for example choose $m_{1}$ as our first body and study the attraction of $m_{2}$ to $m_{1}$, we have to consider the unit vector $\hat{r}$ from $m_{1}$. We then get $$ \vec{F}_{21}=-G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\hat{r} $$
