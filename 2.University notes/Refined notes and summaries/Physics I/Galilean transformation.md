When studying the kinematics of a moving system, it may be useful to write all the vectors of that system in terms of some other coordinate system, which isn't moving. To do this we make use of whats called a Galilean transformation. Given two coordinate systems with origin $O$ and $O'$, and some point in the space $P$, we can write $$ \overrightarrow{OP}=\overrightarrow{O'P}+ \overrightarrow{G}$$Where $G$ is the galilean vector, which clearly is equal to $\overrightarrow{OO'}$. We write $\vec{r}=\overrightarrow{OP}$ and $\vec{r'}=\overrightarrow{O'P}$. Notice that this implies that $$ \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}=\frac{d\vec{r'}}{dt}+\frac{d\vec{G}}{dt} $$And $$ \frac{d^{2}\vec{r}}{dt^{2}}=\frac{d^{2}\vec{r'}}{dt^{2}}+\frac{d^{2}\vec{G}}{dt^{2}} $$
