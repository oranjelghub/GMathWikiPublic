>[!quote] First law
>_Every object perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, except insofar as it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon._

>[!quote] Second law
>_The change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed; and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed._
>
>It follows that $$ \sum^{}_{}\vec{F}=m\vec{a} $$Where on the left we have the sum of all the forces $\vec{F}$ on the object and on the right the associated acceleration vector scaled with the mass of the object.

>[!quote] Third law
>_To every action, there is always opposed an equal reaction; or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts._
>
>If we denote the bodies $i$ and $j$, we can phrase this is $$ \vec{F}_{ij}=-\vec{F}_{ji} $$
