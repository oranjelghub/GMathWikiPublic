We consider the kinematics of a particle in one dimension. Its position is given by it's scalar value $$ x\in \mathbb{R},\; \left[ m \right]  $$It's mean speed is then given by $$ \overline{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\; \left[ \frac{m}{s} \right]  $$Whilst the instantaneous speed is given by the derivative of the position-time function, namely $$ v=\frac{dx}{dt}\; \left[ \frac{m}{s} \right]  $$
The same almost goes for the particles acceleration. It's mean acceleration is given by$$ \overline{a}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\; \left[ \frac{m}{s^{2}} \right]  $$Whilst the instantaneous acceleration is given by the derivative of the speed-time function, namely $$ a=\frac{dv}{dt}\; \left[ \frac{m}{s^{2}} \right]  $$
