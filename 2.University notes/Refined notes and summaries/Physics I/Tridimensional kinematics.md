We consider the kinematics of a particle in three dimensions. Its position is given by it's respective vector $$ (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^{3} $$Movement is then considered through a movement vector between two point $$ \overrightarrow{r_{1}r_{2}}=\vec{r}_{2}-\vec{r}_{1}=\Delta \vec{r} $$Note that if the path with length $\gamma$, taken between two points, isn't a straight line, that $\left| \left| \Delta\vec{r} \right| \right|\leq\gamma$. Since we can express every vector $\vec{r}$ as $$ \vec{r}=x \hat{i}+y \hat{j}+ z\hat{k} $$We can consider the speed of some moving particle by considering $$ \vec{v}=\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}=\frac{dx}{dt}\hat{i}+\frac{dy}{dt}\hat{j}+\frac{dz}{dt}\hat{k} $$The same goes for acceleration $$ \vec{a}= \frac{d^{}\vec{v}}{dt^{}}=\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}\hat{i}+\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}\hat{j}+\frac{d^{2}z}{dt^{2}}\hat{k}  $$
