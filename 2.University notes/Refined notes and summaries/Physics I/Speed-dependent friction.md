Bodies moving through fluids and gasses generate drag and thus generate some friction. This friction is determined in two different manners, depending on size and speed of the body we proceed differently. 

- Small speeds and small objects $$ \vec{F}_{D}=-b\vec{v} $$Where $b$ is some constant which is dependent on the viscosity of the fluid or the size and shape of the object. This formula is essentially reserved for situations with a small Reynolds number.
- High speeds $$ F_{D} \propto v^{2} $$This formula is essentially reserved for situations with a big Reynolds number.
