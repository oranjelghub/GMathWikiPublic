Friction originates from microscopic imperfections on surfaces. It is independent of the size of the surface or the speed of the body moving on it. It is on the other hand dependent on the mass of the body in question and the nature of the surface. 

For a static body the force of the friction $\vec{F}_{fr}$ is given by $$ \left| \vec{F}_{fr} \right| =\mu_{s}\left| \vec{F}_{N} \right|  $$Where $\mu_{s}$ is some experimentally determined, surface dependent, constant and $\vec{F}_{N}$ is the normal force of the body with respect to the surface. 

If on other hand the body is in movement on the surface, then $\vec{F}_{fr}$ is instead given by $$ \left| \vec{F}_{fr} \right| =\mu_{k}\left| \vec{F}_{N} \right|  $$Where $\mu_{k}$ is some different experimentally determined, surface dependent, constant and $\vec{F}_{N}$ is the normal force of the body with respect to the surface. 

The following graph displays some of the connections between $\mu_{s}$ and $\mu_{k}$:
