Suppose that we are in the following situation:

In this situation the moving plate will be experiencing fluid friction, since the movement is creating drag near the plate, causing the friction. The force of this friction can be calculated and is given by $$ \left| \vec{F}_{v} \right|= \eta A  \frac{\left| \vec{v}\right|}{l}   $$Where $\eta$ is the viscosity constant and $A$ the surface of the moving plate.
